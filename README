PSP is free for any purpose (including commercial use) and
is provided without warranty of any kind. I grant you a
permanent, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use and
modify this code (or any of its concepts) in any way you
wish.

If you do use PSP, if incorporate it into another product,
or if it inspires you to create something similar or related,
I ask for a completely optional favor. If you wish to do one
(or more!) of the following - and, again, this is completely
optional - it would by greatly appreciated:

- Donate money to SWI Prolog in my name
- Let me know how you used PSP, and provide some feedback
- Write me a letter of thanks on your corporate letterhead
  PO Box A1070, Sydney South 1235, New South Wales, Australia
- Send me an Amazon.com gift certificate
  feedback@benjaminjohnston.com.au
- Consider contracting me for some Prolog work

I can write up an invoice if this is necessary for your
company's procedures.

Thanks,
