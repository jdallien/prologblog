<p>
Prolog Blog now has an <a href="/posts.rss">RSS feed</a>. I\'ve updated the <a href="http://github.com/jdallien/prologblog">code</a> to include a Prolog templating system extracted from the excellent <a href="http://www.benjaminjohnston.com.au/template.prolog?t=psp">Prolog Server Pages</a> by Benjamin Johnston.

Now that I've got the RSS feed working, I'll be starting the general Prolog posts. As for improving the site itself, my next steps will likely be:
<ul>
<li>Individual post pages, with comments</li>
<li>That CSS I keep meaning to add</li>
</ul>
