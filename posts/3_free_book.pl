Today I found this <a href="http://www.ida.liu.se/~ulfni/lpp/">free PDF copy</a> of the book <i>Logic, Programming and Prolog (2nd edition)</i>, made available by the authors. The book discusses Prolog with a formal logic perspective and it wastes no time jumping into the logic. It is probably not the best starting point for those interested in Prolog but lacking a formal logic background. I am planning to read this book because although I have a formal logic background, a lot of my Prolog education was not with a formal logic perspective. I\'m hoping this book will help connect my education in logic with the knowledge of Prolog to help me write better code.</p>

<p>For those looking to get a lighter introduction to Prolog, there is always the free online version of the excellent <a href="http://www.learnprolognow.org/">Learn Prolog Now!</a>. I first learned Prolog from this website five or six years ago and I highly recommend it.
